Before starting the server, we want to create a db and load it with the relevant info


To create db, run

  rake db:migrate


To load db on the 5 ships to create, run

  rake populate_db:create_ships


Then we simply run

  rails server

To access the site, go to:

  http://localhost:3000/


By default, you'll be logged in under username: "guest". To create a new username or login under an existing username, enter it in the box
